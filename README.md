<h1>First test folder/sandbox repo</h1>

<h4><p>I'm using this depository as a work in progress folder to purposfully break things or try new things out. I'm currently demonstrating a working hangman game as well as an early bootstrapped portfolio. </p></h4>


<p>With some coaching and advice on the javascript from friends, I've somehow made this work. Not with all the features I would like but the basics and some extras work. Thank you to those who have helped me get this far. Thank you to Kevin Miller(classmate) for helping me with images.</p>
